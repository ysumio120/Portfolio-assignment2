					<p>My first exposure to any programming was from my AP Computer Science class in high school. With no previous knowledge, I was very intrigued by the idea that "words" on a screen can create different applications. It wasn't long until I found myself enjoying these applications though they weren't very practical at first. I recently graduated from Rutgers Univeristy in New Brunswick with a Computer Science major and Mathematics minor. Although I did some programming in Java and C, much of studies involved algorithms/effficiency and other theory-based topics.</p>

					<p>My growing passion for coding has opened my eyes to the booming tech world. Coding along with web development allows me to expand on my creativity and further challenges my problem solving capablitlies. The love for coding comes with sleepless nights and frustration; however, this pushes me keep up with the latest technologies and I have been enjoying every second of it.Ultimately, my goal is to not only create pratical applications for users, but build applications that people can appreciate.</p>

					<p>I am currently pursuing a career as a full-stack web developer applying my experiences with Javascript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Node.js, mySQL, and responsive design. I spend a lot of time on the front-end with interests in UX/UI design. Despite my liking for front-end, I also have an understanding of the back-end layer having used Express.js and Sequelize. I expect to continue learning as new technolgies develop and  tackle any problems or tasks, whether it is front-end or back-end programming.</p>
